# Gate for dependency-reviewer: fire when a dependency-bot PR (from bot_author)
# is open and hasn't been handled at its current head commit. The skill records
# each acted-on PR as {number, headSha} in the state file; those are skipped, so
# a lingering bump PR left for a human doesn't relaunch the agent every tick.
# Runs inside working_dir, so gh targets the current repo. Fails closed (no gh,
# no auth) to "skip", the safe default.
