# Discovery gate for review-prs. Exit 0 to launch (work found), non-zero to skip.
# Fires only for a PR matching the filter that hasn't already been reviewed at its
# current head commit — the skill records reviewed PRs as {number, headSha} in the
# state file, and we skip those. This keeps the gate cheap at a tight cadence: a
# review-requested PR that lingers (flag not cleared) won't relaunch the agent every
# tick. Runs inside working_dir, so gh targets the current repo automatically.
