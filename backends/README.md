# Agent backends

A backend teaches dAImon how to drive one agent CLI inside a tmux session. Each
backend is a bash file (`backends/<name>.sh`) sourced by `lib/launch.sh`, selected
per daemon with `[daemon].backend`. Two ship today — `claude` (interactive) and
`codex` (one-shot `codex exec`) — add another by dropping in `backends/<name>.sh`
that implements the contract below.

## Contract

A backend must define these functions:

| Function | Args | Returns / effect |
|----------|------|------------------|
| `backend_bin` | — | Absolute path to the CLI (honor `DAIMON_<NAME>_BIN` override). |
| `backend_cli_args` | `model danger session_name` | The argument string placed after the binary. `danger` is `1`/`0`; map it to the CLI's run-dangerous flag (empty when `0`). |
| `backend_ready_regex` | `danger` | A regex `lib/launch.sh` greps the pane for to know the UI is ready. Echo empty to skip banner detection and use a fixed boot delay instead. |
| `backend_completion_mode` | — | `hook` (a Stop-hook touches the sentinel; precise), `idle` (no hook; completion inferred from heartbeat staleness), or `oneshot` (see below). |

## One-shot backends

A `oneshot` backend is non-interactive: it takes its whole task on stdin and
exits when done, instead of accepting a typed command in a live UI. For these the
launcher renders the daemon's skill to a prompt file and pipes it into the process
(`<env> exec <bin> <cli_args> < prompt`), skips the ready-banner wait and the
command-typing, and treats **process exit** as completion (heartbeat staleness is
only the hang safety-net). `codex` is one — it runs `codex exec`. A oneshot
backend's `backend_ready_regex` is unused, and its `backend_cli_args` may read
`DAIMON_D_WORKING_DIR` (e.g. `codex` trusts it inline to avoid a boot prompt).

## MCP config

When a daemon opts into MCP servers (`[daemon].mcp`), the launcher writes a
`.mcp.json`-style file and exports `DAIMON_MCP_CONFIG` with its path before
calling `backend_cli_args`. A backend that supports MCP should read that env var
and pass the file to its CLI's MCP flag (empty/unset means no MCP). The `claude`
backend maps it to `--mcp-config <file> --strict-mcp-config`.

## How the launcher uses them

`lib/launch.sh` exports `DAIMON_SENTINEL`, `DAIMON_HEARTBEAT`, and `DAIMON_WAIT`,
opens `tmux new-session` running `<env> exec <backend_bin> <backend_cli_args>`,
waits for `backend_ready_regex` (or the boot delay), types the daemon's
`command`, then blocks until: the sentinel appears (`hook` mode), the session
dies, or the heartbeat goes stale for `stuck_after` seconds. Teardown and the
MCP-orphan sweep in `lib/reap.sh` are backend-independent.

## Hooks

`hook`-mode backends need their hooks installed once (the installer merges
`config/hooks/<name>-hooks.*`). The hooks are gated on the `DAIMON_*` env vars so
they are inert in your own non-daemon sessions.
